Features

Core Utility: A single, reliable sponge type designed specifically for efficient water management.

Dynamic States: Transitions between Dry, Moist, and Saturated states based on usage.

Atmospheric Effects:

Dripping: Saturated sponges placed on ceilings or walls will drip water particles.

Steam: Smelting sponges in a furnace produces steam particles.

Advanced Mechanics:

Leaf Drying: Punching leaf nodes with a dry sponge instantly dries them out, perfect for clearing dense foliage.

Manual Squeezing: Shift-click a saturated sponge with an empty bucket to reclaim water manually.

Liquid Blocking: Temporarily places "air" nodes to prevent immediate liquid backflow while clearing.

The Sponge

The primary tool for clearing flood zones and managing water levels in your builds.

Absorption Radius: 4 nodes.

Crafting: Uses standard wool and basic materials for accessibility.

Usage Guide

Clearing Water

Place a Dry Sponge near or inside water. It will instantly absorb all liquid within its 4-node radius and transition to a Saturated state.

Drying the Sponge

Saturated sponges must be dried before they can be used again:

Smelting: Place a Saturated Sponge in a furnace. This produces a Dry Sponge.

Squeezing: Hold an Empty Bucket and Shift + Right-Click a placed Saturated Sponge to empty it instantly and reclaim the water.

Environmental Interaction

Forestry: Use a Dry Sponge to "punch" leaf nodes. The leaves will turn into "Dry Leaves," allowing for quick clearing of jungles or forests.

Decor: Features a unique nodebox design that allows it to look like an industrial filter or a heavy-duty cleaning tool when placed.
